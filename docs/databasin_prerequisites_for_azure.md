during the installation. No other Networking requirements must be met
prior to installation.

#### Option 2: Use an existing or preconfigured Virtual Network

The following network subnets and subnet delegations are required
(subnet names are only suggestions). This must be configured prior to
installation if using an existing Virtual Network or you desire to
configuration the Virtual Network and subnet in advance.


| **Subnet Name**| **Min Size** | **Delegation** | **Service** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| databasin-sn            | /25                 | Microsoft.App/environments                | Microsoft.KeyVault      |
|                         |                     |                                           | Microsoft.Sql           |
